abstract = {Although, several in vitro studies have shown that the high-affinity phosphate transporter Pho84 on its own is competent as a transporter, others have shown that the absence of the GTR1 gene product reduces the capacity of the Pho84 transporter with an impact on the phosphate uptake response as a result. The soluble Gtr1 protein is classified within the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins. Gtr1 has been reported to bind both GDP and GTP, with a preference towards the latter. Studies have shown a significant relationship between the general amino-acid transporter (Gap1p) and the Gtr1 protein concerning its role on the activity and plasma membrane trafficking of the transporter. These types of interactions are still under debate, particularly where Pho84 is involved. A structural model of Gtr1 has been constructed based upon a multiple alignment of proteins from a new subfamily of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases.},
